<TITLE>BAHIA COCOA REVIEW</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SALVADOR, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Showers continued throughout the week in
the Bahia cocoa zone, alleviating the drought since early
January and improving prospects for the coming temporao,
although normal humidity levels have not been restored,
Comissaria Smith said in its weekly review.
    The dry period means the temporao will be late this year.
    Arrivals for the week ended February 22 were 155,221 bags
of 60 kilos making a cumulative total for the season of 5.93
mln against 5.81 at the same stage last year. Again it seems
that cocoa delivered earlier on consignment was included in the
arrivals figures.
    Comissaria Smith said there is still some doubt as to how
much old crop cocoa is still available as harvesting has
practically come to an end. With total Bahia crop estimates
around 6.4 mln bags and sales standing at almost 6.2 mln there
are a few hundred thousand bags still in the hands of farmers,
middlemen, exporters and processors.
    There are doubts as to how much of this cocoa would be fit
for export as shippers are now experiencing dificulties in
obtaining +Bahia superior+ certificates.
    In view of the lower quality over recent weeks farmers have
sold a good part of their cocoa held on consignment.
    Comissaria Smith said spot bean prices rose to 340 to 350
cruzados per arroba of 15 kilos.
    Bean shippers were reluctant to offer nearby shipment and
only limited sales were booked for March shipment at 1,750 to
1,780 dlrs per tonne to ports to be named.
    New crop sales were also light and all to open ports with
June/July going at 1,850 and 1,880 dlrs and at 35 and 45 dlrs
under New York july, Aug/Sept at 1,870, 1,875 and 1,880 dlrs
per tonne FOB.
    Routine sales of butter were made. March/April sold at
4,340, 4,345 and 4,350 dlrs.
    April/May butter went at 2.27 times New York May, June/July
at 4,400 and 4,415 dlrs, Aug/Sept at 4,351 to 4,450 dlrs and at
2.27 and 2.28 times New York Sept and Oct/Dec at 4,480 dlrs and
2.27 times New York Dec, Comissaria Smith said.
    Destinations were the U.S., Covertible currency areas,
Uruguay and open ports.
    Cake sales were registered at 785 to 995 dlrs for
March/April, 785 dlrs for May, 753 dlrs for Aug and 0.39 times
New York Dec for Oct/Dec.
    Buyers were the U.S., Argentina, Uruguay and convertible
currency areas.
    Liquor sales were limited with March/April selling at 2,325
and 2,380 dlrs, June/July at 2,375 dlrs and at 1.25 times New
York July, Aug/Sept at 2,400 dlrs and at 1.25 times New York
Sept and Oct/Dec at 1.25 times New York Dec, Comissaria Smith
said.
    Total Bahia sales are currently estimated at 6.13 mln bags
against the 1986/87 crop and 1.06 mln bags against the 1987/88
crop.
    Final figures for the period to February 28 are expected to
be published by the Brazilian Cocoa Trade Commission after
carnival which ends midday on February 27.

<TITLE>TALKING POINT/BANKAMERICA &lt;BAC> EQUITY OFFER</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    by Janie Gabbett, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LOS ANGELES, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>BankAmerica Corp is not under
pressure to act quickly on its proposed equity offering and
would do well to delay it because of the stock's recent poor
performance, banking analysts said.
    Some analysts said they have recommended BankAmerica delay
its up to one-billion-dlr equity offering, which has yet to be
approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
    BankAmerica stock fell this week, along with other banking
issues, on the news that Brazil has suspended interest payments
on a large portion of its foreign debt.
    The stock traded around 12, down 1/8, this afternoon,
after falling to 11-1/2 earlier this week on the news.
    Banking analysts said that with the immediate threat of the
First Interstate Bancorp &lt;I> takeover bid gone, BankAmerica is
under no pressure to sell the securities into a market that
will be nervous on bank stocks in the near term.
    BankAmerica filed the offer on January 26. It was seen as
one of the major factors leading the First Interstate
withdrawing its takeover bid on February 9.
    A BankAmerica spokesman said SEC approval is taking longer
than expected and market conditions must now be re-evaluated.
    "The circumstances at the time will determine what we do,"
said Arthur Miller, BankAmerica's Vice President for Financial
Communications, when asked if BankAmerica would proceed with
the offer immediately after it receives SEC approval.
    "I'd put it off as long as they conceivably could," said
Lawrence Cohn, analyst with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and
Smith.
    Cohn said the longer BankAmerica waits, the longer they
have to show the market an improved financial outlook.
    Although BankAmerica has yet to specify the types of
equities it would offer, most analysts believed a convertible
preferred stock would encompass at least part of it.
    Such an offering at a depressed stock price would mean a
lower conversion price and more dilution to BankAmerica stock
holders, noted Daniel Williams, analyst with Sutro Group.
    Several analysts said that while they believe the Brazilian
debt problem will continue to hang over the banking industry
through the quarter, the initial shock reaction is likely to
ease over the coming weeks.
    Nevertheless, BankAmerica, which holds about 2.70 billion
dlrs in Brazilian loans, stands to lose 15-20 mln dlrs if the
interest rate is reduced on the debt, and as much as 200 mln
dlrs if Brazil pays no interest for a year, said Joseph
Arsenio, analyst with Birr, Wilson and Co.
    He noted, however, that any potential losses would not show
up in the current quarter.
    With other major banks standing to lose even more than
BankAmerica if Brazil fails to service its debt, the analysts
said they expect the debt will be restructured, similar to way
Mexico's debt was, minimizing losses to the creditor banks.

    Moody's said Marathon Oil Co's recent establishment of up

prolific Yates Field has significant negative implications for
USX's unsecured creditors.
    The company appears to have positioned its steel segment
for a return to profit by late 1987, Moody's added.
    Ratings lowered include those on USX's senior debt to BA-1
from BAA-3.

quarter, ending February 28, profits may be below the 2.4 mln
dlrs, or 15 cts a share, earned in the first quarter of fiscal
1986.
    The company said any decline would be due to expenses
related to the acquisitions in the middle of the current
quarter of seven licensees of Sealy Inc, as well as 82 pct of
the outstanding capital stock of Sealy.
    Because of these acquisitions, it said, first quarter sales
will be substantially higher than last year's 67.1 mln dlrs.
    Noting that it typically reports first quarter results in
late march, said the report is likely to be issued in early
April this year.
    It said the delay is due to administrative considerations,
including conducting appraisals, in connection with the
acquisitions.

<TITLE>ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - BANKAMERICA &lt;BAC></TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    by Janie Gabbett, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LOS ANGELES, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>BankAmerica Corp is not under
pressure to act quickly on its proposed equity offering and
would do well to delay it because of the stock's recent poor
performance, banking analysts said.
    Some analysts said they have recommended BankAmerica delay
its up to one-billion-dlr equity offering, which has yet to be
approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
    BankAmerica stock fell this week, along with other banking
issues, on the news that Brazil has suspended interest payments
on a large portion of its foreign debt.
    The stock traded around 12, down 1/8, this afternoon,
after falling to 11-1/2 earlier this week on the news.
    Banking analysts said that with the immediate threat of the
First Interstate Bancorp &lt;I> takeover bid gone, BankAmerica is
under no pressure to sell the securities into a market that
will be nervous on bank stocks in the near term.
    BankAmerica filed the offer on January 26. It was seen as
one of the major factors leading the First Interstate
withdrawing its takeover bid on February 9.
    A BankAmerica spokesman said SEC approval is taking longer
than expected and market conditions must now be re-evaluated.
    "The circumstances at the time will determine what we do,"
said Arthur Miller, BankAmerica's Vice President for Financial
Communications, when asked if BankAmerica would proceed with
the offer immediately after it receives SEC approval.
    "I'd put it off as long as they conceivably could," said
Lawrence Cohn, analyst with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and
Smith.
    Cohn said the longer BankAmerica waits, the longer they
have to show the market an improved financial outlook.
    Although BankAmerica has yet to specify the types of
equities it would offer, most analysts believed a convertible
preferred stock would encompass at least part of it.
    Such an offering at a depressed stock price would mean a
lower conversion price and more dilution to BankAmerica stock
holders, noted Daniel Williams, analyst with Sutro Group.
    Several analysts said that while they believe the Brazilian
debt problem will continue to hang over the banking industry
through the quarter, the initial shock reaction is likely to
ease over the coming weeks.
    Nevertheless, BankAmerica, which holds about 2.70 billion
dlrs in Brazilian loans, stands to lose 15-20 mln dlrs if the
interest rate is reduced on the debt, and as much as 200 mln
dlrs if Brazil pays no interest for a year, said Joseph
Arsenio, analyst with Birr, Wilson and Co.
    He noted, however, that any potential losses would not show
up in the current quarter.
    With other major banks standing to lose even more than
BankAmerica if Brazil fails to service its debt, the analysts
said they expect the debt will be restructured, similar to way
Mexico's debt was, minimizing losses to the creditor banks.

<TITLE>DEAN FOODS &lt;DF> SEES STRONG 4TH QTR EARNINGS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Dean Foods Co expects earnings for the
fourth quarter ending May 30 to exceed those of the same
year-ago period, Chairman Kenneth Douglas told analysts.
    In the fiscal 1986 fourth quarter the food processor
reported earnings of 40 cts a share.
    Douglas also said the year's sales should exceed 1.4
billion dlrs, up from 1.27 billion dlrs the prior year.
    He repeated an earlier projection that third-quarter
earnings "will probably be off slightly" from last year's 40
cts a share, falling in the range of 34 cts to 36 cts a share.
    Douglas said it was too early to project whether the
anticipated fourth quarter performance would be "enough for us
to exceed the prior year's overall earnings" of 1.53 dlrs a
share.
    In 1988, Douglas said Dean should experience "a 20 pct
improvement in our bottom line from effects of the tax reform
act alone."
    President Howard Dean said in fiscal 1988 the company will
derive  benefits of various dairy and frozen vegetable
acquisitions from Ryan Milk to the Larsen Co.
    Dean also said the company will benefit from its
acquisition in late December of Elgin Blenders Inc, West
Chicago.
    He said the company is a major shareholder of E.B.I. Foods
Ltd, a United Kingdom blender, and has licensing arrangements
in Australia, Canada, Brazil and Japan.
    "It provides ann entry to McDonalds Corp &lt;MCD> we've been
after for years," Douglas told analysts.

<TITLE>BROWN-FORMAN &lt;BFDB> SETS STOCK SPLIT, UPS PAYOUT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LOUISVILLE, Ky., Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Brown-Forman Inc said its board
has approved a three-for-two stock split and a 35 pct increase
in the company cash dividend.
    The company cited its improved earnings outlook and
continued strong cash flow as reasons for raising the dividend.
    Brown-Forman said the split of its Class A and Class B
common shares would be effective March 13.
    The company said directors declared a quarterly cash
dividend on each new share of both classes of 28 cts, payable
April one to holders of record March 20. Prior to the split,
the company had paid 31 cts quarterly.
    Brown-Forman today reported a 37 pct increase in third 
quarter profits to 21.6 mln dlrs, or 1.00 dlr a share, on a
seven pct increase in sales to a record 337 mln dlrs.
    Brown-Forman said nine month profits declined a bit to 66.0
mln dlrs, or 3.07 dlrs a share, from 66.2 mln dlrs, or 3.08
dlrs a share, a year earlier due to a second quarter charge of
37 cts a share for restructuring its beverage operations.
    The company said lower corporate tax rates and the
restructuring "are expected to substantially improve
Brown-Forman's earnings and cash flow in fiscal 1988."

<TITLE>BANKERS REPORT BREAKTHROUGH ON VENEZUELAN DEBT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Venezuela and its bank advisory
committee have agreed in principle on revisions to the terms of
a 21 billion dlr debt-rescheduling package signed last
February, bankers said.
    They declined to disclose details because two or three
representatives on the panel have still to obtain the approval
of their senior management for the new terms.
    The committee was meeting in New York this afternoon and
could put its final stamp of approval of the deal later today,
the bankers said.
    "A number of details have still to be finalized, but the
broad details of the new amortization schedules and interest
rates are in place," one senior banker said.
    The interest rate on the rescheduling was originally set at
1-1/8 pct over Eurodollar rates, but Venezuela requested easier
terms because of a 40 pct drop in oil income last year.
    It also asked for a reduction in the repayments it was due
to make in 1987, 1988 and 1989 - after an earlier request that
it make no amortizations at all in those years was rebuffed -
and sought a commitment from the banks to finance new
investment in Venezuela.
    The breakthrough in the Venezuelan talks, which have been
going on intermittently for several months, follows the
announcement earlier today of a 10.6 billion dlr debt
rescheduling pact between Chile and its bank advisory panel.
    And last night Citibank said Mexico's financing package,
including a 7.7 billion dlr loan, will be signed on March 20.
    While the sudden progress is to some extent coincidental,
bankers acknowledge a desire to chalk up some quick successes
after the shock of Brazil's unilateral interest suspension last
Friday. By striking swift deals, banks hope to reduce the
incentive for other debtors to emulate Brazil.

<TITLE>TOWER REPORT DIMINISHES REAGAN'S HOPES OF REBOUND</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Michael Gelb, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Tower Commission report, which
says President Reagan was ignorant about much of the Iran arms
deal, just about ends his prospects of regaining political
dominance in Washington, political analysts said.
    "This is certification of incompetence," private political
analyst Stephen Hess told Reuters in commenting on the Tower
report made public today.
    "It's as if he went before a professional licensing board
and was denied credentials."
    In one of the most direct criticisms, board chairman John
Tower, a longtime Reagan supporter and former Republican
senator from Texas, told a press conference, "The president
clearly did not understand the nature of this operation."
    The report, which lent credence to widespread opinion in
Washington that Reagan is not in full command of the
government, was particularly damaging because it was prepared
by a board of the Republican president's own choosing.
    The three-member panel made up of Tower, former National
Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft and former Secretary of State
Edmund Muskie, does not carry the partisan taint of criticism
from a Congress controlled by the Democratic party.
    "We're falling by our own hand," said one Republican
political strategist. "What can we say except 'we're sorry, we
won't do it again'?"
    The strategist, who works for one of his party's top 1988
presidential contenders and asked not to be identified, said
the report was like "an anvil falling on us."
    Hess, with the Brookings Institution public policy study
group, said the report is the final blow to Reagan's hopes of
regaining the upper hand he once had in dealings with Congress,
the press and the Washington bureaucracy.
    The report may also undermine the standing of Defense
Secretary Caspar Weinberger and Secretary of State George
Shultz, who the report suggests were more interested in keeping
their own skirts clean than supporting the president.
    "They protected the record as to their own positions on this
issue. They were not energetic in attempting to protect the
president from the consequences," it said.
    White House chief of staff Donald Regan and former Central
Intelligence Agency Director William Casey also received strong
criticism, but the blows were expected in their cases.
    Regan, expected to resign or be fired shortly, was savaged
for allegedly failing both to help Reagan conduct the Iran
initiative and to avoid "chaos" in the disclosure process.
    Casey, who underwent surgery for removal of a cancerous
brain tumor in December, had already resigned for health
reasons last month.
    "This is a story about people who came up somewhat short of
being heroes," Tower told reporters.
    While Reagan retains considerable constitutional powers,
including command of the armed forces and the right to veto
legislation, analysts say it will be difficult for him to
retake control of the country's policy agenda -- particularly
with Congress controlled by the Democrats.
    The crucial remaining question, they said, is whether the
man in the street will forsake Reagan over the affair.
    Although his job approval rating has fallen as much as
twenty percentage points in some opinion polls since the arms
deal with Iran became public last November, his personal
popularity is still relatively high.
    A Los Angeles Times poll released earlier this week showed
that just 37 pct of those surveyed thought Reagan was in
control of the government, but 55 pct still thought he was
doing a good job as president.
    American Enterprise Institute analyst William Schneider, a
Democrat, says Reagan's loss of support among Washington power
brokers could be offset by continued backing of the public.
    "In the past, he has been able to go around the power elite
by appealing directly to the public," Schneider said.
    Reagan will again plead his case that way in a televised
address next week.
    But one top Republican strategist warned against expecting
a dramatic turnaround.
    "The White House has to avoid building expectations that
cannot be met," said the strategist, who requested anonymity.
"They have to recognize there is no quick fix."
    Analysts also point out that Reagan's personal popularity
has not always translated into public backing for his policies.
    They note he was dramatically rebuffed in last November's
elections when voters rejected his appeals and restored control
of the Senate to the Democrats.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Sales of previously owned homes
dropped 14.5 pct in January to a seasonally adjusted annual
rate of 3.47 mln units, the National Association of Realtors
(NAR) said.
    But the December rate of 4.06 mln units had been the
highest since the record 4.15 mln unit sales rate set in
November 1978, the group said.
    "The drop in January is not surprising considering that a
significant portion of December's near-record pace was made up
of sellers seeking to get favorable capital gains treatment
under the old tax laws," said the NAR's John Tuccillo.

<TITLE>SENATORS INTRODUCE EXPORT LICENSING REFORM BILL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Sens. Alan Cranston (D-Cal.) and
Daniel Evans (R-Wash.) said they introduced export licensing
reform legislation that could save U.S. companies hundreds of
thousands of dollars annually.
    "Our emphasis is two-fold: Decontrol and de-license items
where such actions will not endanger our national security, and
eliminate the Department of Defense's de facto veto authority
over the licensing process," Cranston said.
    "Our reforms should reduce licensing requirements by 65  to
70 pct," he told reporters. "I am convinced that a more
rational...licensing process will boost exports."
    U.S. export controls are intended to deny Eastern bloc
countries access to technology that could further their
military capabilities.
    "By refocusing our control resources on higher levels of
technology, technology that is truly critical, we will do a
better job of preventing diversion of critical technology to
our adversaries while promoting more exports," Cranston said.
    "We cannot expect to continue to play a leading role in new
technology development in the future if we unduly restrict the
activities of U.S. firms in the world market-place," Evans told
reporters.

<TITLE>CHEMLAWN &lt;CHEM> RISES ON HOPES FOR HIGHER BIDS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Cal Mankowski, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>ChemLawn Corp &lt;CHEM> could attract a
higher bid than the 27 dlrs per share offered by Waste
Management Inc &lt;WNX>, Wall Street arbitrageurs said.
    Shares of ChemLawn shot up 11-5/8 to 29-3/8 in
over-the-counter- trading with 3.8 mln of the company's 10.1
mln shares changing hands by late afternoon.
    "This company could go for 10 times cash flow or 30 dlrs,
maybe 32 dollars depending on whether there is a competing
bidder," an arbitrageur said. Waste Management's tender offer,
announced before the opening today, expires March 25.
    "This is totally by surprise," said Debra Strohmaier, a
ChemLawn spokeswoman. The company's board held a regularly
scheduled meeting today and was discussing the Waste Management
announcement. She said a statement was expected but it was not
certain when it would be ready. 
    She was unable to say if there had been any prior contact
between Waste Management and ChemLawn officials.
    "I think they will resist it," said Elliott Schlang,
analyst at Prescott, Ball and Turben Inc. "Any company that
doesn't like a surprise attack would."
    Arbitrageurs pointed out it is difficult to resist tender
offers for any and all shares for cash. Schlang said ChemLawn
could try to find a white knight if does not want to be
acquired by Waste Management.
    Analyst Rosemarie Morbelli of Ingalls and Snyder said
ServiceMaster Companies L.P. &lt;SVM> or Rollins Inc &lt;ROL> were
examples of companies that could be interested.
    ChemLawn, with about two mln customers, is the largest U.S.
company involved in application of fertilizers, pesticides and
herbicides on lawns. Waste Management is involved in removal of
wastes.
    Schlang said ChemLawn's customer base could be valuable to
another company that wants to capitalize on a strong
residential and commercial distribution system.
    Both Schlang and Morbelli noted that high growth rates had
catapulted ChemLawn's share price into the mid-30's in 1983 but
the stock languished as the rate of growth slowed.
    Schlang said the company's profits are concentrated in the
fourth quarter. In 1986 ChemLawn earned 1.19 dlrs per share for
the full year, and 2.58 dlrs in the fourth quarter.
    Morbelli noted ChemLawn competes with thousands of
individual entrepreuers who offer lawn and garden care sevice.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Sugar imports subject to the U.S.
sugar import quota during the week ended January 9, the initial
week of the 1987 sugar quota year, totaled 5,988 short tons
versus 46,254 tons the previous week, the Agriculture
Department said.
    The sugar import quota for the 1987 quota year

compared with 1,850,000 tons in the 1986 quota year, which was

    The department said the Customs Service has reported that
weekly and cumulative imports are reported on an actual weight
basis and when final polarizations are received, cumulative
import data are adjusted accordingly.

<TITLE>BRAZIL ANTI-INFLATION PLAN LIMPS TO ANNIVERSARY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    RIO DE JANEIRO, Feb 26 - Brazil's "Cruzado" anti- </DATELINE><BODY>inflation
plan, initially hailed at home and abroad as the saviour of the
economy, is limping towards its first anniversary amid soaring
prices, widespread shortages and a foreign payments crisis.
    Announced last February 28 the plan froze prices, fixed the
value of the new Cruzado currency and ended widespread
indexation of the economy in a bid to halt the country's 250
pct inflation rate.
    But within a year the plan has all but collapsed.
    "The situation now is worse than it was. Although there was
inflation, at least the economy worked," a leading bank
economist said.
    The crumbling of the plan has been accompanied by a
dramatic reversal in the foreign trade account. In 1984 and
1985 Brazil's annual trade surpluses had been sufficient to
cover the 12 billion dlrs needed to service its 109 billion dlr
foreign debt.
    For the first nine months of 1986 all seemed to be on
target for a repeat, with monthly surpluses averaging one
billion dlrs. But as exports were diverted and imports
increased to avoid further domestic shortages the trade surplus
plunged to 211 mln dlrs in October and since then has averaged
under 150 mln.

<TITLE>U.S. DATA POINT TO CAPITAL SPENDING SLOWDOWN</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Kathleen Hays, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>A surprise 7.5 pct drop in U.S. January
durable goods orders points to a slowdown in capital spending
that could presage lackluster real growth in the U.S. economy
in the first quarter of 1987, economists said.
    With total orders, excluding the volatile defense sector,
falling a record 9.9 pct, economists agreed that the report
painted a bleak picture for the U.S. economy.
    But they stressed that the 1987 tax reform laws may be a
primary factor behind the drop in orders for business capital
investment.
    "It's a rather gloomy outlook for the economy, said David
Wyss of Data Resources Inc. "I'm particularly impressed by the
19.7 pct drop in non-defense capital goods orders because it
may be a sign that businesses are reacting more adversely to
tax reform than we thought."
    The Commerce Department pointed out that a record 14.8 pct
decline in new orders for machinery was led by declines in
office and computing equipment orders.
    Economists said the drop in computer orders may have been a
response to the lengthening of depreciation schedules and the
end of the investment tax credit under the new tax laws.
    "It's more expensive to invest than it used to be, so
people just aren't doing it as much," Wyss said.
     Increases in durable goods orders at year's end reinforced
the view that businesses anticipated the changing tax laws,
economists said.
    November durable goods orders rose 5.1 pct and December's
increased 1.5 pct, revised upwards from a previously reported
0.9 pct.
    But most acknowledged that the huge January drop was caused
by more than tax reform.
    "The wash-out that took place in January was far greater
than the actual gains that took place in November and
December," said Bill Sullivan of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. "The
economy has a weakening bent to it early in the year."
    "The report definitely points to very sluggish capital
spending over the next couple of quarters," said Donald Maude
of Midland Montagu Capital Markets Inc.
    Maude pointed to a continuing decline in order backlogs as
evidence that the outlook for new orders is not improving. In
November, order backlogs rose 0.6 pct, but in December they
fell 0.6 pct and in January 0.7 pct, he said.
    "It suggests orders in the pipeline are depleting, which
may quickly translate to a drop in production," Midland
Montagu's Maude said.
    Wyss cautioned that too much should not be made of
January's report, given that other reports have reflected
strength.
    But he acknowledged that the decline occurred despite a 51
pct rise in defense orders, compared with a 57.7 pct decline in
December.
    He also noted that there was a 6.9 pct drop in January
shipments, compared with a 5.4 pct rise in December.
    "Given these numbers, there's no reason for the Fed to
tighten," Data Resources' Wyss said.
    "But there's no reason to ease unless we see more numbers
like this. The Fed will wait and see," he added.
    Sullivan predicted the Fed will ease by Easter. "People
aren't talking recession or Fed easing now, but the Fed will
have to ease to ensure global growth."

<TITLE>SENATORS INTRODUCE EXPORT LICENSING REFORM BILL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Sens. Alan Cranston (D-Cal.) and
Daniel Evans (R-Wash.) said they introduced export licensing
reform legislation that could save U.S. companies hundreds of
thousands of dollars annually.
    "Our emphasis is two-fold: Decontrol and de-license items
where such actions will not endanger our national security, and
eliminate the Department of Defense's de facto veto authority
over the licensing process," Cranston said.
    "Our reforms should reduce licensing requirements by 65  to
70 pct," he told reporters. "I am convinced that a more
rational...licensing process will boost exports."
    U.S. export controls are intended to deny Eastern bloc
countries access to technology that could further their
military capabilities.
    "By refocusing our control resources on higher levels of
technology, technology that is truly critical, we will do a
better job of preventing diversion of critical technology to
our adversaries while promoting more exports," Cranston said.
    "We cannot expect to continue to play a leading role in new
technology development in the future if we unduly restrict the
activities of U.S. firms in the world market-place," Evans told
reporters.

operating loss for the January 31 second quarter, said
prospects for the balance of the fiscal year remain good.
    It said orders at its Harris Graphics subsidiary, acquired
in June 1986, "continue to run at a strong pace." For the six
months, orders rose 35 pct over the corresponding prior-year
period, or on an annualized basis are running at about 630 mln
dlrs.
    The backlog at Harris is up 30 pct from the beginning of
the fiscal year, AM said.
    AM International said its old division are expected to
benefit from recent new product introductions and the decline
in the value of the dollar.
    "Research, development and engineering expenditures in
fiscal 1987 will be in the 45-50 mln dlr range, and the company
said it has allocated another 30-40 mln dlrs for capital
expenditures.
    Earlier AM reported a fourth quarter operating loss of two
cts a share compared to profits of seven cts a share a year
ago. Revenues rose to 291.8 mln dlrs from 151.1 mln dlrs.

<TITLE>ARGENTINA COULD SUSPEND DEBT PAYMENTS - DEPUTY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BUENOS AIRES, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Argentina could suspend payments on
its foreign debt if creditor banks reject a 2.15 billion dlr
loan request to meet 1987 growth targets, ruling Radical Party
Deputy Raul Baglini told a local radio station.
    "Argentina does not discard the use of (a moratorium) if the
negotiations do not produce a result that guarantees the growth
of the country," he added.
    Baglini, an observer at Argentina's negotiations in New
York with the steering committee for its 320 creditors banks,
told the Radio del Plata in a telephone interview that the
banks were divided on the loan request.
    Baglini said that as a result, today's scheduled second day
of talks had been postponed.
    He said Argentina was prepared to follow the example of
Brazil, which last week declared a moratorium on interest
payments of a large portion of its 108 billion dlr foreign
debt.
    Argentina's prime objective in renegotiating the debt was
to maintain growth, which has been targeted at four pct in
1987, Baglini said.
    "Debtor nations should not have to take from their own
pockets, that is their commercial balance, to meet interest
payments," he added.

<TITLE>KEY U.S. TAX WRITERS SEEK ESTATE TAX CURBS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>The chairmen and senior Republican
members of the House and Senate tax writing committees proposed
legislation to curb estate tax deduction on sales of stock to
an employee stock ownership plan.
    The proposal would raise federal revenues of 6.7 billion
dlrs over the fiscal year period 1987 to 1991.
    If adopted by Congress it would effect all transactions
after Sept 26, 1987.
    The plan was proposed by House Ways and Means Committee
Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill), Rep John Duncan (R-Tenn),
Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen (D-Tex) and Sen
Bob Packwood (R-Ore).
    In a statement Rostenkowski said the estate tax deduction
enacted last year as part of the tax reform bill was too broad
and would have cost the governmet seven billion dlrs over four
years. The narrower deduction would cost the government less
than 300 mln dlrs for the same years.
    He said it was designed to avoid sham transactions which
allowed estates to avoid taxes by transferring stock to ESOPs.
    Senate Finance Committee chairman Lloyd Bentsen said in a
statement, "The Tax Reform Act contains a provision that allows
many wealthy individuals to avoid the federal estate tax
entirely when they die."
    He added, "The provision was intended to encourage estates
to sell stock to employee stock ownership plans as a way of
promoting worker ownership; however, the provision was not
meant to be broad enough to reduce federal revenues as much as
is currently estimated."
    He added, "The bill I have introduced today calls for the
modification of the provision in accordance with its intended
purpose."

<TITLE>CANADA'S WILSON SEEKS TEMPORARY BORROWING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    OTTAWA, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Canadian Finance Minister Michael Wilson
said he will use temporary authority under the Financial
Administration act to borrow an additional 600 mln dlrs in next
Thursday's treasury bill auction.
    In a statement, Wilson said the action would permit the
government to proceed with its debt program during a period
when there was not sufficient borrowing authority, which is
granted by Parliament, to cover the government's needs.
    Ottawa announced previously it was seeking Parliamentary
approval for the additional authority to cover the financing of
an increase in the government's foreign reserves.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>QUEBECOR &lt;PQB> HEAD SEES NEW VENTURES LIKELY</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Jane Arraf, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    MONTREAL, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Quebecor Inc, one of Canada's largest
publishing and printing companies, is likely to launch a new
daily newspaper in Montreal, probably this fall, president
Pierre Peladeau told Reuters in an interview.
    The company, which last week won a bid to buy the Quebec
government's 55 pct interest in pulp and paper company &lt;Donohue
Inc>, will also likely go ahead with plans to build a new paper
mill in Matane, Quebec, Peladeau said.
    "I would say we will move (ahead with the daily).... This
is not definite but i think we will," he said, adding that he
plans to announce a decision early next week.
    Quebecor, which had revenues of 446 mln Canadian dlrs last
year and profit of 16.2 mln dlrs, already publishes three daily
newspapers, including the tabloid Le Journal de Montreal, the
second-largest circulation paper in Canada.
    A new daily would give Montreal its second English-
language paper and its sixth daily newspaper, making the city
the most crowded metropolitan newspaper market in North
America, analysts have said.
    Peladeau said market studies have indicated a new English
language tabloid would have circulation of 50,000 within six
months. He said he is waiting to determine whether the new
venture would have the support of major advertisers.
    Peladeau, who together with family members owns about 55
pct of Quebecor, said he has recieved offers from the heads of
two major Canadian companies who are interested in the project
but has not decided whether he would take partners in the
newspaper venture.
    He said he would consider launching the newspaper with one
of the companies as a prelude to other joint ventures.
    "It would be the possibility of doing something else in the
short term," Peladeau said.
    Peladeau said the joint acquisition of Donohue with Robert
Maxwell's British Printing and Communications Corp plc &lt;BPCL.L>
does not mean Quebecor will have to hold off on other projects.
    Peladeau and Maxwell's companies teamed up to buy the stake
in Donohue, which resulted in Quebecor buying 51 pct of the
govvernment's stake for about 165 mln Canadian dlrs and British
printing acquiring the other 49 pct.
    "In 1976 or 77 there was a tremendous shortage of
newsprint. There were days when we didn't have enough paper to
print the paper," Peladeau said. "When I lived that, I said to
myself...next time we'll be ready."
    Peladeau said most of Donohue's current total newsprint
capacity however, is already committed to other buyers.
    Quebecor uses about 100,000 metric tons of newsprint a year
and Maxwell's company, which publishes Britain's Daily Mirror
newspaper, uses about 200,000 tonnes.
    Peladeau said even with a new 170 mln dlr paper machine, 49
pct owned by the New York Times, (NYT.A), adding to Donohue's
540,000 metric tonne capacity this fall, the companies will
have to install another paper machine at Amos, Quebec, or build
another mill to meet their demands .
    He said a new mill, which would produce either newsprint or
other types of paper, would cost 400-500 mln dlrs and could be
on stream in two years. He said a mill in Matane, a depressed
area with high unemployment, would be heavily subsidized by the
government.
    Peladeau said he is interested in further joint ventures
with Maxwell's company, either in the newspaper market in
France or in the U.S., where the company owns two large
printing plants and is looking to expand its newspaper empire.
    He said Maxwell's sons, who are French citizens, would
provide an entree into the French market, where foreigners are
prevented from buying newspapers. Peladeau said he would
consider either buying into or starting daily newspapers in
France or the U.S.
    Quebecor is also in the process of expanding its chain of
about 40 weekly newspapers, with the possible acquisition of
two groups of weekly newspapers in the U.S., and is negotiating
the acquisition of two weekly newspaper chains in Canada,
Peladeau said.
    He said the company may consider starting daily newspapers
in two small Quebec cities and buying radio stations in the
province.
    Peladeau said Quebecor may also consider trading in its
listing on the American stock exchange for a New York Stock
Exchange listing.

<TITLE>IRAN ANNOUNCES END OF MAJOR OFFENSIVE IN GULF WAR</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Iran announced tonight that its major
offensive against Iraq in the Gulf war had ended after dealing
savage blows against the Baghdad government.
    The Iranian news agency IRNA, in a report received in
London, said the operation code-named Karbala-5 launched into
Iraq on January 9 was now over.
    It quoted a joint statewment by the Iranian Army and
Revolutionary Guards Corps as saying that their forces had
"dealt one of the severest blows on the Iraqi war machine in the
history of the Iraq-imposed war."
    The statement by the Iranian High Command appeared to
herald the close of an assault on the port city of Basra in
southern Iraq.
    "The operation was launched at a time when the Baghdad
government was spreading extensive propaganda on the resistance
power of its army...," said the statement quoted by IRNA.
    It claimed massive victories in the seven-week offensive
and called on supporters of Baghdad to "come to their senses" and
discontinue support for what it called the tottering regime in
Iraq.
    Iran said its forces had "liberated" 155 square kilometers of
enemy-occupied territory during the 1987 offensive and taken
over islands, townships, rivers and part of a road leading into
Basra.
    The Iranian forces "are in full control of these areas," the
statement said.
    It said 81 Iraqi brigades and battalions were totally
destroyed, along with 700 tanks and 1,500 other vehicles. The
victory list also included 80 warplanes downed, 250 anti-
aircraft guns and 400 pieces of military hardware destroyed and
the seizure of 220 tanks and armoured personnel carriers.

<TITLE>U.S. BANK DISCOUNT BORROWINGS 310 MLN DLRS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. bank discount window borrowings
less extended credits averaged 310 mln dlrs in the week to
Wednesday February 25, the Federal Reserve said.
    The Fed said that overall borrowings in the week fell 131
mln dlrs to 614 mln dlrs, with extended credits up 10 mln dlrs
at 304 mln dlrs. The week was the second half of a two-week
statement period. Net borrowings in the prior week averaged 451
mln dlrs.
    Commenting on the two-week statement period ended February
25, the Fed said that banks had average net free reserves of
644 mln dlrs a day, down from 1.34 billion two weeks earlier.
    A Federal Reserve spokesman told a press briefing that
there were no large single day net misses in the Fed's reserve
projections in the week to Wednesday.
    He said that natural float had been "acting a bit
strangely" for this time of year, noting that there had been
poor weather during the latest week.
    The spokesman said that natural float ranged from under 500
mln dlrs on Friday, for which he could give no reason, to
nearly one billion dlrs on both Thursday and Wednesday.
    The Fed spokeman could give no reason for Thursday's high
float, but he said that about 750 mln dlrs of Wednesday's
float figure was due to holdover and transportation float at
two widely separated Fed districts.
    For the week as a whole, he said that float related as of
adjustments were "small," adding that they fell to a negative
750 mln dlrs on Tuesday due to a number of corrections for
unrelated cash letter errors in six districts around the
country.
    The spokesman said that on both Tuesday and Wednesday, two
different clearing banks had system problems and the securities
and Federal funds wires had to be held open until about 2000 or
2100 EST on both days.
    However, he said that both problems were cleared up during
both afternoons and there was no evidence of any reserve
impact.
    During the week ended Wednesday, 45 pct of net discount
window borrowings were made by the smallest banks, with 30 pct
by the 14 large money center banks and 25 pct by large regional
institutions.
    On Wednesday, 55 pct of the borrowing was accounted for by
the money center banks, with 30 pct by the large regionals and
15 pct by the smallest banks.
    The Fed spokesman said the banking system had excess
reserves on Thursday, Monday and Tuesday and a deficit on
Friday and Wedndsday. That produced a small daily average
deficit for the week as a whole.
    For the two-week period, he said there were relatively high
excess reserves on a daily avearge, almost all of which were at
the smallest banks.

<TITLE>AMERICAN EXPRESS &lt;AXP> SEEN IN POSSIBLE SPINNOFF</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Patti Domm, Reuter</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    New York, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>American Express Co remained silent on
market rumors it would spinoff all or part of its Shearson
Lehman Brothers Inc, but some analysts said the company may be
considering such a move because it is unhappy with the market
value of its stock.
    American Express stock got a lift from the rumor, as the
market calculated a partially public Shearson may command a
good market value, thereby boosting the total value of American
Express. The rumor also was accompanied by talk the financial
services firm would split its stock and boost its dividend.
    American Express closed on the New York Stock Exchange at
72-5/8, up 4-1/8 on heavy volume.
    American Express would not comment on the rumors or its
stock activity.
    Analysts said comments by the company at an analysts'
meeting Tuesday helped fuel the rumors as did an announcement
yesterday of management changes.
    At the meeting, company officials said American Express
stock is undervalued and does not fully reflect the performance
of Shearson, according to analysts.
    Yesterday, Shearson said it was elevating its chief
operating officer, Jeffery Lane, to the added position of
president, which had been vacant. It also created four new
positions for chairmen of its operating divisions.
    Analysts speculated a partial spinoff would make most
sense, contrary to one variation on market rumors of a total
spinoff.
    Some analysts, however, disagreed that any spinoff of
Shearson would be good since it is a strong profit center for
American Express, contributing about 20 pct of earnings last
year.
    "I think it is highly unlikely that American Express is
going to sell shearson," said Perrin Long of Lipper Analytical.
He questioned what would be a better investment than "a very
profitable securities firm."
    Several analysts said American Express is not in need of
cash, which might be the only reason to sell a part of a strong
asset.
    But others believe the company could very well of
considered the option of spinning out part of Shearson, and one
rumor suggests selling about 20 pct of it in the market.
    Larry Eckenfelder of Prudential-Bache Securities said he
believes American Express could have considered a partial
spinoff in the past.
    "Shearson being as profitable as it is would have fetched a
big premium in the market place. Shearson's book value is in
the 1.4 mln dlr range. Shearson in the market place would
probably be worth three to 3.5 bilion dlrs in terms of market
capitalization," said Eckenfelder.
    Some analysts said American Express could use capital since
it plans to expand globally.
    "They have enormous internal growth plans that takes
capital. You want your stock to reflect realistic valuations to
enhance your ability to make all kinds of endeavors down the
road," said E.F. Hutton Group analyst Michael Lewis.
    "They've outlined the fact that they're investing heavily
in the future, which goes heavily into the international
arena," said Lewis. "...That does not preclude acquisitions and
divestitures along the way," he said.
    Lewis said if American Express reduced its exposure to the
brokerage business by selling part of shearson, its stock might
better reflect other assets, such as the travel related
services business.
    "It could find its true water mark with a lesser exposure
to brokerage. The value of the other components could command a
higher multiple because they constitute a higher percentage of
the total operating earnings of the company," he said.
     Lewis said Shearson contributed 316 mln in after-tax
operating earnings, up from about 200 mln dlrs in 1985.

<TITLE>COLECO INDUSTRIES &lt;CLC> SEES PROFIT IN 1987</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WEST HARTFORD, Conn., FEb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Coleco Industries Inc said
it expects to return to profitability in 1987.
    Earlier, Coleco reported a net loss of 111.2 mln dlrs for
the year ended December 31 compared to a profit of 64.2 mln
dlrs in the year earlier.
    In a prepared statement, the company said the dramatic
swing in operating results was due primarily to the steep
decline in sales of Cabbage Patch Kids products from 600 mln
dlrs to 230 mln dlrs.
    Coleco said it changed from a single product company to a
more diversified organization through four major acquisitions
last year.
    Products from the new acquisitions and other new product
introductions are expected to enable it to return to
profitability, it said.
    At the annual Toy Fair earlier this month, vice president
Morton Handel said analysts' 1987 projected earnings of 90 cts
a share on sales of 600 mln dlrs are reasonable.

<TITLE>GAO LIKELY TO SHOW CERTS MORE COSTLY THAN CASH</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>A study on grain certificates due out
shortly from the Government Accounting Office (GAO) could show
that certificates cost the government 10 to 15 pct more than
cash outlays, administration and industry sources said.
    Analysis that the GAO has obtained from the Agriculture
Department and the Office of Management and Budget suggests
that certificates cost more than cash payments, a GAO official
told Reuters.
    GAO is preparing the certificate study at the specific
request of Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), former chairman of the
senate agriculture committee.
    The report, which will focus on the cost of certificates
compared to cash, is scheduled to be released in mid March.
    The cost of certificates, said the GAO source, depends on
the program's impact on the USDA loan program.
    If GAO determines that certificates encourage more loan
entries or cause more loan forfeitures, then the net cost of
the program would go up. However, if it is determined that
certificates have caused the government grain stockpile to
decrease, the cost effect of certificates would be less.
    GAO will not likely suggest whether the certificates
program should be slowed or expanded, the GAO official said.
    But a negative report on certificates "will fuel the fire
against certificates and weigh heavily on at least an increase
in the certificate program," an agricultural consultant said.
    The OMB is said to be against any expansion of the program,
while USDA remains firmly committed to it.

<TITLE>Venezuela seeks 'flexibility' from banks-azpurua</TITLE>
<DATELINE>     Caracas, feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>venezuela is seeking a 'constructive and
flexible' attitude from its creditor banks in current talks to
reschedule 21 billion dlrs in foreign debt, finance minister
manuel azpurua told a press conference.
    He declined to comment on meetings this week in new york
between public finances director jorge marcano and venezuela's
13-bank advisory committee except to say, "they are
progressing."
    Azpurua said venezuela has shown solidarity with brazil's
decision to suspend payments, but each country must negotiate
according to its own interest.
    Asked to comment on chile's agreement with its creditors
today, which includes an interest rate margin of one pct over
libor, azpurua said only, "that is good news."
    According to banking sources, the banks' latest offer to
venezuela is also a one pct margin as against the last
february's 1-1/8 pct rescheduling accord and the 7/8 pct
Venezuela wants.
    Azpurua said four basic elements are being negotiated with
the banks now: spread reduction, deferral of principal payments
due in 1987 and 1988, lenghtening the 12-1/2 year repayment
schedule, and debt capitalization schemes.
    Azpurua said the governent plans to pay 2.1 billion dlrs in
public and private debt principal this year. It was due to
amortize 1.05 billion dlrs under the rescheduling, and pay 420
mln dlrs in non-restructured principal, both public sector.
    He said venezuela's original proposal was to pay no
principal on restructured debt this year, but is now insisting
that if it makes payments they be compensated by new bank
loans.
    The banking sources said the committee has been prepared to
lower amortizations to around 400 mln dlrs this year, but that
no direct commitment was likely on new loans.
    "debtors and bank creditors have a joint responsibility and
there will be no lasting solution unless a positive flow of
financing is guaranteed," azpurua said.
    However, he appeared to discard earlier venezuelan
proposals for a direct link between oil income and debt
payments, "because circumstances change too quickly."
    At the same time, he said the government is presently
studying possible mechanisms for capitlizing public and private
sector foreign debt, based on experience in other countries.
The rules would be published by the finance ministry and the
central bank.

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Thomson McKinnon Mortgage Assets Corp, a
unit of Thomson McKinnon Inc, is offering 100 mln dlrs of
collateralized mortgage obligations in three tranches that
include floating rate and inverse floating rate CMOS.
    The floating rate class amounts to 60 mln dlrs. It has an
average life of 7.11 years and matures 2018. The CMOs have an
initial coupon of 7.0375 pct, which will be reset 60 basis
points above LIBOR, said sole manager Thomson McKinnon.
    The inverse floater totals 4.8 mln dlrs. It has an average
life of 13.49 years and matures 2018. These CMOs were given an
initial coupon of 11-1/2 pct and priced at 104.40.
    Subsequent rates on the inverse floater will equal 11-1/2
pct minus the product of three times (LIBOR minus 6-1/2 pct).
    A Thomson officer explained that the coupon of the inverse
floating rate tranche would increase if LIBOR declined. "The
yield floats opposite of LIBOR," he said.
    The fixed-rate tranche totals 35.2 mln dlrs. It has an
average life of 3.5 years and matures 2016. The CMOs were
assigned a 7.65 pct coupon and par pricing.
    The issue is rated AAA by Standard and Poor's and secured
by Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp, Freddie Mac, certificates.

<TITLE>OPEC MAY HAVE TO MEET TO FIRM PRICES - ANALYSTS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    BY TED D'AFFLISIO, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>OPEC may be forced to meet before a
scheduled June session to readdress its production cutting
agreement if the organization wants to halt the current slide
in oil prices, oil industry analysts said.
    "The movement to higher oil prices was never to be as easy
as OPEC thought. They may need an emergency meeting to sort out
the problems," said Daniel Yergin, director of Cambridge Energy
Research Associates, CERA.
    Analysts and oil industry sources said the problem OPEC
faces is excess oil supply in world oil markets.
    "OPEC's problem is not a price problem but a production
issue and must be addressed in that way," said Paul Mlotok, oil
analyst with Salomon Brothers Inc.
    He said the market's earlier optimism about OPEC and its
ability to keep production under control have given way to a
pessimistic outlook that the organization must address soon if
it wishes to regain the initiative in oil prices.
    But some other analysts were uncertain that even an
emergency meeting would address the problem of OPEC production
above the 15.8 mln bpd quota set last December.
    "OPEC has to learn that in a buyers market you cannot have
deemed quotas, fixed prices and set differentials," said the
regional manager for one of the major oil companies who spoke
on condition that he not be named. "The market is now trying to
teach them that lesson again," he added.
    David T. Mizrahi, editor of Mideast reports, expects OPEC
to meet before June, although not immediately. However, he is
not optimistic that OPEC can address its principal problems.
    "They will not meet now as they try to take advantage of the
winter demand to sell their oil, but in late March and April
when demand slackens," Mizrahi said.
    But Mizrahi said that OPEC is unlikely to do anything more
than reiterate its agreement to keep output at 15.8 mln bpd."
    Analysts said that the next two months will be critical for
OPEC's ability to hold together prices and output.
    "OPEC must hold to its pact for the next six to eight weeks
since buyers will come back into the market then," said Dillard
Spriggs of Petroleum Analysis Ltd in New York.
    But Bijan Moussavar-Rahmani of Harvard University's Energy
and Environment Policy Center said that the demand for OPEC oil
has been rising through the first quarter and this may have
prompted excesses in its production.
    "Demand for their (OPEC) oil is clearly above 15.8 mln bpd
and is probably closer to 17 mln bpd or higher now so what we
are seeing characterized as cheating is OPEC meeting this
demand through current production," he told Reuters in a
telephone interview.

<DATELINE>    DALLAS, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Cenergy Corp reported fourth quarter net
income of 790,000 dlrs or seven cts per share on revenues of
7.7 mln dlrs.
    For the year it reported a net loss of 6.5 mln dlrs or 70
cts per share as a result of writedowns in the book value of
its oil and gas properties in the first two quarters. Revenues
were 37 mln dlrs.
    Following the company's fiscal year ended March 31, 1985,
it changed to a calender year end.
    For the nine months ended Dec 31, 1985, it reported a loss
of 63.4 mln dlrs or 6.54 dlrs per share on revenues of 47.6 mln
dlrs, which it said was a result of noncash writedowns of oil
and gas properties.
    For the year ended March 31, 1985, Cenergy reported net
income of 3,705,000 dlrs or 36 cts per share on revenues of 71
mln dlrs.
    The company said its reserves during the year fell to five
mln barrels from 6.4 mln barrels of oil and to 60.1 bilion
cubic feet of gas from 63.7 BCF. It said these reserves did not
disappear but are available to produce as prices recover.

<DATELINE>    CALGARY, Alberta, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Nova, the Canadian company that
owns 56 pct of Husky Oil Ltd, said it received government
approval for a transaction under which &lt;Union Faith Canada
Holding Ltd> would buy a 43 pct stake in Husky.
    Nova said the Minister of Regional and Industrial
Expansion, Michel Cote, ruled that Union Faith's purchase of
the Husky stake would not result in Husky ceding control to a
non-Canadian company. It said this ruling was a key condition
in completing the deal.
    Union Faith is equally owned by &lt;Hutchison Whampoa Ltd> and
&lt;Hong Kong Electric Holdings Ltd>.
    Under the agreement with Union Faith, Husky will become a
private company with Union Faith and Nova each holding 43 pct
of its stock.
    Nine pct of Husky would be owned by relatives of Li
Ka-Shing, chairman of Hutchison, and five pct by the Canadian
Imperial Bank of Commerice.

(FDIC) said three troubled banks in Texas and Louisiana were
merged with healthy financial institutions.
    The FDIC said it subsidized the merger of Central Bank and

that Central was in danger of failing.
    Central had assets of 28.3 mln dlrs.

Bank, Hart, Tex., were assumed by Hale County State Bank,
Plainview, Tex.
    Farmers, with 9.6 mln dlrs in assets, was closed by Texas
bank regulators.
    The deposits of the failed First National Bank of Crosby,
Crosby, Tex., with total assets of 8.2 mln dlrs, were assumed
by Central Bancshares of the South Inc, Birmingham, Ala., after
First National was closed by federal bank regulators, the FDIC
said.
    The number of federally insured banks to fail so far this
year now totals 32, the FDIC said.

<TITLE>BANKS EXPRESS GRAVE CONCERN ON BRAZIL DEBT MOVES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Brazil's 14-bank advisory committee
expressed "grave concern" to chief debt negotiator Antonio
Padua de Seixas over the country's suspension of interest
payments, according to a telex from committee chairman Citibank
to creditor banks worldwide.
    Bankers said the diplomatic phrase belied the deep anger
and frustration on the committee over Brazil's unilateral move
last Friday and its subsequent freeze on some 15 billion dlrs
of short-term trade and interbank lines.
    Seixas, director of the Brazilian central bank's foreign
debt department, met the full panel on Tuesday and Wednesday.
    Seixas, who met again this morning with senior Citibank
executive William Rhodes and representatives from committee
vice-chairmen Morgan Guaranty Trust Co and Lloyds Bank Plc,
told the banks that the government was preparing a telex to
explain and clarify the freeze on short-term credits.
    The telex could be sent to creditors as early as today,
bankers said.
    Despite the rising tempers, bankers said there are no plans
for Brazilian finance minister Dilson Funaro to meet commercial
bankers during his trip to Washington on Friday and Saturday.
    Funaro will be explaining Brazil's actions to U.S. Treasury
Secretary James Baker, Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul
Volcker and International Monetary Fund managing director
Michel Camdessus before travelling to Europe at the weekend.
    Meanwhile, bankers were to hear in New York this afternoon
what impact Brazil's hard line would have on Argentina, with an
initial presentation from Argentine Treasury Secretary Mario
Brodersohn on his country's request for 2.15 billion dlrs in
new loans and a multi-year rescheduling agreement. Argentina
has threatened to emulate Brazil's payments moratorium if the
banks do not grant its request.

<TITLE>LNG IMPORTS FROM ALGERIA UNLIKELY IN 1987</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    BY NAILENE CHOU WIEST, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Liquefied natural gas imports from
Algeria are unlikely to happen in 1987 even though its
economically feasible, U.S. industry analysts sources said.
    Youcef Yousfi, director-general of Sonatrach, the Algerian
state petroleum agency, indicated in a television interview in
Algiers that such imports would be made this year.
    "Contract negotiations, filing with the U.S. government and
the time required to restart mothballed terminals will delay
the import until 1988/1989," Daniel Tulis, a natural gas
analyst with Shearson Lehman Bros. said.
    Sonatrach is currently negotiating with two of its former
customers, Panhandle Eastern &lt;PEL> and Distrigas, a subsidiary
of Cabot Corp &lt;CBT> to resume LNG export, company officials
told Reuters. A third, El Paso Gas, a subsidiary of Burlington
Northern &lt;BNI>, has expressed no interest.
    Industry analysts said some imports of Algerian LNG were
feasible. "On a marginal cost basis, the companies that have
made capital investment to handle LNG import can operate
profitably even in the current price environment,"  Frank
Spadine, an energy economist with Bankers Trust, said.
   Analysts did not forsee a major impact from Algerian imports
on U.S. prices which are currently soft but expected to trend
higher by the end of 1987.
    A decline in gas drilling and the time lag to bring Gulf of
Mexico productions onstream will tighten gas supplies and firm
prices, Shearson's Tulis said.
   In this context, Algerian LNG import would be a source of
supplemental supply to U.S. domestic production, he added.
    Company sources currently in talks with Algeria agree,
saying that Algerian LNG would only serve to meet peak demand.
    Company sources also said that any negotiations with
Algeria would emphasize looser arrangements which would relate
volumes to market requirements and prices to U.S. spot market
values.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>U.S. FARM CREDIT RESCUE BILL SEEN BEFORE EASTER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>The chairman of the Senate Agriculture
subcommittee on credit said the panel will consider a farm
credit rescue package by Easter even if the system and its
regulator do not ask for help by then.
    "We're going to have a bill to markup, I guarantee you,
before the Easter recess," Sen. David Boren (D-Okla.) said.
    Senate Majority leader Robert Byrd (D-W.Va.) wants
recommendations on farm credit presented by April 11, when
Congress is scheduled to break for Easter, Boren said.
    Boren urged the Farm Credit Administration (FCA), the
system's regulator, to quickly make a formal request for aid.
    Under the 1985 Farm credit law passed by Congress, the FCA,
as regulator, is to certify when the system has exhausted all
its capital and needs federal government help.
    However, FCA chairman Frank Naylor said because much of the
system's remaining capital is tied-up in legal action,
he could not technically certify a rescue is needed this year
and perhaps not even in 1988. The other Republican member of
the three-man FCA board, Marvin Duncan, agreed.
    But Boren urged that even if FCA cannot technically certify
aid is needed, it should request help informally.
    "We all know we need a capital infusion," Boren said.
    Boren and the FCA officials spoke at a hearing on the
plight of the farm credit system. Also at the hearing, Brent
Beesely, chief executive of the Farm Credit Council
representing the system, said that at the end of 1986 the
system had only 1.5 billion dlrs in working capital remaining
after losses of 4.6 billion dlrs over the last two years.
    While he did not ask for government aid, Beesley indicated
the situation is serious in some of the 12 system districts.
    "A significant number of banks and associations in the most
economically depressed areas have and will continue to suffer
extraordinary losses," Beesley said.
    Jim Billington, Democratic member of the FCA board, said
the troubles of the system have encouraged the flight of some
one billion dlrs per month from the system as borrowers repay
loans.
    The system's total portfolio shrank to 54.6 billion dlrs by
the end of last year from 66.6 billion the previous year.
    FCA board members said both borrowers and holders of bonds
in the system need to be assured their money is safe. Naylor
suggested the need for a federal assurance to bondholders.
    "The bondholders have no worry at this time," Billington
said.
    Naylor said several proposals for revamping the farm credit
system are circulating. The proposals range from consolidation
of the system into a centralized national lender, to
de-centralizing into semi-independent institutions.
    But He and the system spokesman Beesley were cautious about
proposals for a secondary market on farm loans. Those
proposals would package farm loans for resale to investors.
    Naylor and Beesley said a secondary market set-up outside
the farm credit system would hurt the system. But Beesley said
a secondary market with the farm credit system as its agent
could be developed without Congressional legislation.

<TITLE>REPORT COULD BE FINAL BLOW FOR REGAN</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Sue Baker, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Tower Commission's scathing   
comments on President Reagan's embattled chief of staff Donald
Regan could signal the death knell to his White House tenure,
but the impact of its strong criticism on two other top
officials was less clear.
    Regan has come in for tough criticism for his handling of
Reagan's worst political crisis since details of the covert
arms sales to Iran and diversion of profits to Nicaraguan
rebels first emerged last November.
    But criticism of the roles of Secretary of State George
Shultz and Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger, who said they
opposed the Iran arms initiative yet failed to end it, had been
muted until the release of the Tower Commission report.
    "Their obligation was to give the president their full
support and continued advice with respect to the program or, if
they could not in conscience do that, to so inform the
president," the report said after a three-month probe.
    "Instead, they simply distanced themselves from the program.
They protected the record as to their own positions on this
issue. They were not energetic in attempting to protect the
president from the consequences of his personal commitment to
freeing the hostages."
    The report saved some of its most scathing language for
Regan, a gruff former Wall Street executive and close personal
friend of Reagan whose autocratic rule in the White House
angered some top Reagan officials and, perhaps more
importantly, Reagan's wife Nancy.
    "More than almost any chief of staff of recent memory, he
asserted personal control over the White House staff and sought
to extend this control to the national security adviser," said
the report.
    Washington analysts said Regan's departure now appeared to
be only a matter of timing. Many expected the president to
announce it when he addresses the nation on the Tower
Commission's findings next week.
    With Regan's departure apparently imminent and Poindexter
and other key figures in the scandal already out of office, the
report's tough criticism of Shultz and Weinberger could turn
the spotlight on their future.
    Senate Republican leader Robert Dole, a key Reagan ally,
told reporters the report disclosed "colossal blunders" and said
people who had not served the president well should step aside,
but he did not specify who should go.
    "It would seem to me that if you don't protect the
president, you don't serve the president well, then you should
move on," the Kansas Republican, a likely presidential candidate
next year, said.
    One Republican strategist said he believed Regan would not
be the only White House official to leave in the near future.

<TITLE>SWISS ECONOMY IN EXCELLENT CONDITION, OECD SAYS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Switzerland's economy, combining low
unemployment, financial stability and a large external payments
surplus, is in excellent condition and faces a satisfactory
future, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and
Development, OECD, said.
    This reflected the success of stable and relatively tight
fiscal and monetary policies followed by the government, it
said.
    The OECD, in its annual report on Switzerland, picked out
some signs of a slowdown in activity and a slight pick-up in
inflation this year, but said these gave no cause for concern.
    The study forecast a decline in Gross Domestic Product
growth to 1.75 pct this year from an estimated two pct in 1986
and a small rise in consumer price inflation to 1.25 pct after
last year's sharp fall to 0.75 pct from 3.6 pct in 1985.
    But it said job creation should continue to absorb a modest
increase in the workforce, leaving the unemployment rate
unchanged at around one pct, the lowest in the 24-industrial
nation OECD area.
    Assuming an average exchange rate of 1.71 Swiss francs to
the dollar this year, against 1.69 in the second half of 1986,
the report forecast a 2.75 pct rise in exports and a 3.5 pct
rise in imports this year after rises of 3.25 pct and 6.5 pct
respectively in 1986.
    The faster growth of imports compared with exports this
year and last, reflecting buoyant private consumption, meant
that the contribution of the foreign payments balance to GDP
would shrink in both years.
    But "given Switzerland's large external surplus, there
should be no concern if domestic demand grows faster than
GDP...Which, if only in a small way, would contribute to
improving international balances," the OECD said.
    Real private consumption appeared to have been unusually
buoyant last year, with a 3.25 pct growth rate, after several
years of relative weakness, it noted.
    In 1987 private consumption was expected to slow somewhat
to a 2.25 pct growth rate, but should still outstrip overall
GDP, it added.
    The outlook for investment in plant and machinery remained
bright into 1987, and with capacity use at near record levels
last year there was scope for rationalisation and modernisation
in both the industry and service sectors, it said.
    As a consequence, growth in machinery and equipment
investment is likely to decelerate only slightly this year
after vigorous growth in 1986.
    But the report raised a questionmark over the prospects for
tourism and the banking industry, two major service sector
earners of foreign exchange.
    The long-term appreciation of the Swiss Franc, and the
accelerating deregulation of foreign banking markets, could
lead to a loss of international market share for both, it said.
    Particularly for the banks, "recent developments in
international financial markets give rise to the question
whether the Swiss financial system, which has shown substantial
flexibility in the past, is adapting itself at the speed
required ... To preserve its competitive position," it said.

<TITLE>U.S. WHEAT BONUS TO SOVIET CALLED DORMANT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. Agriculture Department is not
actively considering offering subsidized wheat to the Soviet
Union under the export enhancement program (EEP), senior USDA
officials said.
    However, grain trade analysts said the proposal has not
been ruled out and that an offer might be made, though not in
the very near future.
    "The grain companies are trying to get this fired up again,"
an aide to Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said. "But there
just isn't much talk about it, informally or formally."
    Most analysts interviewed by Reuters were more confident
than USDA officials that bonus wheat would be offered to the
Soviets, even though U.S. officials did not make such an offer
when they held grain talks with Soviet counterparts earlier
this week.
    But administration and private sources agreed that if the
Reagan administration did decide to offer subsidized wheat to
Moscow, it could take several months.
    "I just don't see any proposal like that sailing through any
interagency process," the aide to Lyng said.
    "An export enhancement offer is not consummated overnight,"
said one former USDA official, who noted that the
administration took three months to decide in favor of selling
China wheat under the subsidy program.
    An official representing a large grain trade company said
deliberations within USDA might be nudged along by members of
Congress, a number of whom urged USDA this week to make a wheat
subsidy offer to the Soviets.
    But Lyng's aide said that during a day-long visit to
Capitol Hill yesterday, House members did not press the
secretary on the subsidy question a single time.
    The administration's interagency trade policy review group,
comprised of subcabinet-level officials, has not been asked to
clear a request to offer Moscow wheat under the EEP, officials
at the U.S. Trade Representative's Office said.
    In their talks this week, the two sides discussed the
administration's previous EEP offer but did not talk about any
new initiative. One USDA official who took part in the
consultations this week described them as an exchange of "calm,
basic, factual economics."
    Another USDA official said there was "not even an informal
suggestion or hint" that the Soviets would live up to their
pledge to buy four mln tonnes of wheat this year if they were
granted more favorable terms.
    USDA and private sources agreed that consideration of an
EEP initiative by interagency review groups likely would be
delayed because of disarray within the White House stemming
from the Iran arms affair.

<TITLE>U.S. TREASURY PART OF ARGENTINE BRIDGE LOAN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. Treasury said it was willing
to participate with several other industrial countries in
providing a 500 mln-dlr short-term bridge loan to Argentina.
    The Treasury announcecement did not name the other
countries nor the amount of financing the United States was
willing to supply.
    Argentina announced a wage and price freeze on Wednesday
night and is negotiating with New York bankers for about 2.15
billion dlrs in new loans and other financing.
    "Our willingness to participate in this multilateral
short-term financing indicates our support for Argentina's
economic program to achieve sustainable growth and a viable
balance of payments position," the Treassury statement said.
    In announcing a four-month wage and price freeze, Argentine
officials said the country needed "a more serene climate" to
carry out structural changes in the economy.
    But Argentina did not suspend interest payments on its
foreign debts, as neighboring Brazil did last week.
    The Treasury said the U.S. share of bridge financing for
Argentina would come from its Exchange Stabilization Fund.
    The one-page statement noted the International Monetary
Fund expressed confidence in Argentina's economic policies and
prospects by approving a new stand-by financing arrangement for
it on February 18.
    "Argentina is expected to qualify for IMF
balance-of-payments financing which would enable Argentina to
repay a multilateral bridge loan and support the implementation
of its economic program," the statement said.
    The latest Argentine action marked the second time in less
than two years its government has used a wage and price freeze
to restrain inflation.
    The debt talks in New York are being headed by Argentine
Finance Minister Mario Brodersohn and are expected to last for
several days.
    Along with new financing, Argentina reportedly wants lower
interest rates on an existing total 53 billion dlrs in foreign
debt and elimination of foreign banks' control over how some of
the money is loaned in Argentina.

<TITLE>BANKS EXPRESS GRAVE CONCERN ON BRAZIL DEBT MOVE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Brazil's 14-bank advisory committee
expressed "grave concern" to chief debt negotiator Antonio
Padua de Seixas over the country's suspension of interest
payments, according to a telex from committee chairman Citibank
to creditor banks worldwide.
    Bankers said the diplomatic phrase belied the deep anger
and frustration on the committee over Brazil's unilateral move
last Friday and its subsequent freeze on some 15 billion dlrs
of short-term trade and interbank lines.
    Seixas, director of the Brazilian central bank's foreign
debt department, met the full panel on Tuesday and Wednesday.
    Seixas, who met again this morning with senior Citibank
executive William Rhodes and representatives from committee
vice-chairmen Morgan Guaranty Trust Co and Lloyds Bank Plc,
told the banks that the government was preparing a telex to
explain and clarify the freeze on short-term credits.
    The telex could be sent to creditors as early as today,
bankers said.
    Despite the rising tempers, bankers said there are no plans
for Brazilian finance minister Dilson Funaro to meet commercial
bankers during his trip to Washington on Friday and Saturday.
    Funaro will be explaining Brazil's actions to U.S. Treasury
Secretary James Baker, Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul
Volcker and International Monetary Fund managing director
Michel Camdessus before travelling to Europe at the weekend.
    Meanwhile, bankers were to hear in New York this afternoon
what impact Brazil's hard line would have on Argentina, with an
initial presentation from Argentine Treasury Secretary Mario
Brodersohn on his country's request for 2.15 billion dlrs in
new loans and a multi-year rescheduling agreement. Argentina
has threatened to follow Brazil in declaring a payments
moratorium if the banks do not grant its request.

<TITLE>JURY FINDS FOR DOW &lt;DOW> IN BIRTH DEFECT CASE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PHILADELPHIA, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Dow Chemical Co's &lt;DOW> Merrell Dow
Pharmaceuticals Inc unit said a jury found that Bendectin did
not cause the birth defects of a seven-year old boy whose
mother took the drug during pregnancy.
    The anti-nausea drug has been used to treat morning 
sickness and was discontinued in 1983 amid allegations that the
drug caused birth defects.
    Merrell said that to date there have been 12 other trials
involving the drug, 10 in the U.S. and two in West Germany.
    It said verdicts or judgements in favor of the company were
obtained in eight of the trials, one of which included about
1,150 plaintiffs.
    In two trials, Merrell said, verdicts were in favor of the
plaintiffs. In one, it said, the trial judge overruled the
jury's verdict and issued a judgement in favor of the company
and a three judge panel of the Court of Appeals overturned the
trial judge's ruling. Merrell is now awaiting a rehearing of
this case by the full Court of Appeals.
    Of the remaining two trials, one ended in a mistrial and in
the other the jury was unable to reach a verdict.
    At one point about 1700 lawsuits had been filed alleging
the drug caused birth defects, said a company spokesman. He
said about 300 lawsuits are pending.
    Bendectin was first introduced in the early 1950s, and the
Merrell spokesman said a valid application to make and market
the drug is with the Food and Drug Administration should the
company decide it wants to reintroduce it.

probably will not offer a two dlr per bushel bonus payment to
corn farmers for any erodible cropland they enrolled in the
conservation reserve program last year, an aide to USDA
Secretary Richard Lyng said.
    Sen. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) said yesterday that Lyng had
indicated he would consider giving those farmers the same two
dlr bonus offered corn farmers who are signing up for the 1987
program this month.
    But the aide to Lyng said it was doubtful that the
department would offer a retroactive bonus to farmers who
enrolled land in the 10-year conservation reserve last year.
    "How are you going to stop the tide," he said, referring to
demands that would follow from other commodity groups.

<TITLE>AGENCY VOTES TO END LOCAL NUCLEAR PLANT VETO</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Nuclear Regulatory Commission
(NRC) proposed to ease evacuation standards for nuclear plants,
which could lead the way to the licensing of controversial
plants in New York and New Hampshire.
    The NRC voted 4-1 to offer the rule for 60 days of public
comment before it reconsidered it and set emergency evacuation
standards of its own.
    Local authorites at the plants at Shoreham, Long Island,
N.Y., and Seabrook, N.H., had refused to take part in
evacuation planning, as required under existing NRC rules.
    They had claimed the region was too populated for any safe
evacuation plan, holding up the NRC's authority to issue full
power licenses of the two multi-billon dollar plants.
    A group of prominent politicians, led by New York Governor
Mario Cuomo, charged at a public meeting on the proposed plan
on Tuesday that NRC members were more interested in protecting
the utilties'investments than protecting public safety.
    An NRC spokesman said after the meeting that the agency had
not yet scheduled a meeting to vote on the proposed plan.
    In a statement today announcing its vote, the commission
said the proposed rule change would enable the NRC to act in
cases where local authorities refused to take part in emergency
evacuation planning.

grown oats for their own use but failed to certify to the
government that they had done so probably will be allowed to
continue planting that crop and be eligible for corn program
benefits, an aide to Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said.
    Currently a farmer, to be eligible for corn program
benefits, must restrict his plantings of other program crops to
the acreage base for that crop.
    Several members of Congress from Iowa have complained that
farmers who inadvertantly failed to certify that they had grown
oats for their own use in the past now are being asked to halt
oats production or lose corn program benefits.
    USDA likely will allow historic oats farmers to plant oats
but not extend the exemption to all farmers, Lyng's aide said.

National Soybean Processors Association this afternoon at 21.78
mln bushels, down from the 22 mln bushel plus rate seen over
the past two months when crush margins surged to the best
levels seen in over a year.
    Active soymeal export loadings at the Gulf had pushed
soybean futures and premiums higher, prompting a pick-up in the
weekly crush number.
    However, much of that export demand seems to have been met,
with most foreign meal users now waiting for the expected surge
in shipments of new crop South American soymeal over the next
few months.
    U.S. processors are now finding domestic livestock feed
demand is very light for this time of year due to the milder
than normal winter, so they steadily dropped offering prices in
an attempt to find buying interest, soyproduct dealers said.
    Soybean meal futures have also steadily declined in recent
weeks, setting a new contract low of 139.70 dlrs per ton in the
nearby March contract today.
    "Many speculators down here bought March soymeal and sold
May, looking for no deliveries (on first notice day tomorrow,
which would cause March to gain on deferreds)," one CBT crush
trader said.
    "But they've been bailing out this week because the March
has been acting like there will be a lot delivered, if not
tomorrow, then later in the month," he added.
    As a result of the weakness in soymeal, the March crush
ratio (The value of soyproducts less the cost of the soybeans)
fell from the mid 30s earlier this month to 22.6 cents per
bushel today, dropping over five cents in just the last two
days.
    The May crush ended today just over 17 cents, so no
processors will want to lock in a ratio at that unprofitable
level, the trader said. Hopefully, they will now start to cut
back production to get supplies in line with demand, he added.
    With futures down, processors are finding they must bid
premiums for cash soybeans, further reducing crush margins.
    A central Illinois processor is only making about 30 cents
for every bushel of soybeans crushed at current prices, down
sharply from levels just seen just a few weeks ago and below
the average cost of production, cash dealers said.
    Most soybean processing plants are still in operation, with
little talk of taking temporary down-time, so far. But
processors will start halting production in the next few weeks
it they continue to face unprofitable margins, they added.

<TITLE>FED DATA SUGGEST STABLE U.S. MONETARY POLICY</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    by Jeremy Solomons, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Latest Federal Reserve data suggest that
the central bank voted to maintain the existing degree of
pressure on banking reserves at its regular policy-making
meeting two weeks ago, money market economists said.
    "The numbers were a little disappointing, but I think we
can take Mr Volcker at his word when he said that nothing had
changed," said Bob Bannon of Security Pacific National Bank.
    Fed Chairman Paul Volcker told a Congressional committee
last Thursday that the Fed's policy "has been unchanged up to
today."
    Although Volcker's statement last Thursday allayed most
fears that the Fed had marginally tightened its grip on
reserves to help an ailing dollar, many economists still wanted
confirmation of a steady policy in today's data, which covered
the two-week bank statement period ended yesterday.
    This need for additional reassurance was made all the more
acute by the Fed's decision yesterday to drain reserves from
the banking system by arranging overnight matched sale-purchase
agreements for the first time since April of last year,
economists added.
    Today's data showed that the draining action was for a
fairly large 3.9 billion dlrs, economists said.
    "The one thing that caught my eye were the relatively
sizeable matched sales on Wednesday," said Dana Johnson of
First National Bank of Chicago. "But there was a clearly
justified need for them. There was nothing ominous."
    "The Fed couldn't have waited until the start of the new
statement period today. If it had, it would have missed its
(reserve) projections," added Security Pacific's Bannon.
    A Fed spokesman told reporters that there were no large
single-day net miss in reserve projections in the latest week.
    Economists similarly shrugged off slightly higher-than-
expected adjusted bank borrowings from the Fed's discount
window, which averaged 310 mln dlrs a day in the latest week,
compared with many economists' forecasts of about 200 mln.
    For the two-week bank statement period as a whole, the
daily borrowing average more than doubled to 381 mln dlrs from
160 in the prior period.
    "There were wire problems at two large banks on Tuesday and
Wednesday, so I am not too bothered about the borrowings," said
Scott Winningham of J.S. Winningham and Co. The Wednesday
average rose to 946 mln dlrs from 148 mln a week earlier.
    Lending further support to the stable policy view was a
relatively steady federal funds rate of about six pct in the
latest week and persistently high levels of excess reserves in
the banking system, economists said.
    "For the time being, the Fed is following a neutral path,
with fed funds at about six to 6-1/8 pct," said Darwin Beck of
First Boston Corp. "I expect it to continue in that vein."
    "Excess reserves fell but they are still over a billion
dlrs," added First Chicago's Johnson. Banks' excess reserves
averaged 1.03 billion dlrs a day in the latest statement
period, down from 1.50 billion in the previous one.
    After the Fed declined to assign a 1987 target growth range
to the wayward M-1 money supply measure last week, little
attention was paid to a steeper-than-anticipated 2.1 billion
dlr jump in the week ended February 16.
    Looking ahead, economists said the Fed will have to tread a
fine line between the dollar's progress in the international
currency markets and the development of the domestic economy.
    "The market has perhaps exaggerated the dollar's effect on
Fed policy," said First Chicago's Johnson. "Of course, it will
take the dollar into account in future policy decisions but if
the economy is weak, it won't pull back from easing."

here today in NASA's first successful launch of the year.
    The 116-foot (35.4-meter) Delta -- a reliable workhorse of

    The launch came after two delays in two days. The first
postponement was caused by fuel leak and the second by
high-speed crosswinds that NASA officials say could have torn
the rocket apart during fiery ascent.

<TITLE>JAPAN TO TRY TO OPEN MARKET TO U.S. CAR PARTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japan has pledged to try to increase
its purchase of U.S. car parts and also to exchange data to
monitor the purchases, the Commerce Department said.
    U.S. negotiators opened talks last August with Japanese
officials to try to force open the Japanese market to
American-made parts in an effort to redress an estimated five
billion dlr deficit in car parts trade.
    Japan had agreed to try to increase purchases of U.S.-made
parts by Japanese car makers and to begin long term contracts
for parts purchases, a Commerce department official said.
    He added that the agreement also said Japan agreed to try
to devise a way to collect purchasing information in order to
monitor progress in stepping up Japanese orders.
    The Commerce Department said in a statement last year that
"statistics support the perception in the United States that
American auto parts suppliers are not welcome in the inner
circles of Japan's auto companies and their traditional
suppliers."
    It estimated that while Japan's car firms sold almost five
billion dlrs worth of parts in the United States in 1985, U.S.
firms sold only one per cent of Japan's 55 billion dlr market.

<TITLE>FRANCE FACES PRESSUE TO CHANGE POLICIES</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Brian Childs, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>France's right wing government is facing
growing pressure to modify its economic policies after revising
down its 1987 growth targets and revising up its inflation
forecasts for this year.
    Moving reluctantly into line with most private sector
forecasts the government yesterday raised its 1987 inflation
estimate a half percentage point to 2.5 per cent and cut its
economic growth estimate to between two and 2.8 per cent from a
2.8 per cent target written into the annual budget last
september.
    Finance Minister Edouard Balladur said the revised figures
would not push the government off its chosen mix of price
deregulation, budget-cutting rigour and pay restraint.
    But Trade Union leaders served immediate notice they would
push to protect the purchasing power of their members, raising
the spectre of a vicious spiral of wage and price rises.
    And bank economists contacted by Reuters said they believed
Prime Minister Jacques Chirac could be forced by slow growth
and rising unemployment to reflate the economy later this year,
perhaps in the autumn, to boost his prospects in Presidential
elections due by April 1988.
    "The outlook is more worrying than it was a few weeks ago,"
said Societe Generale economist Alain Marais. "We have the
impression it may be difficult to get even two per cent growth
this year."
    "The big question is whether the government's policy of wage
moderation will be maintained," he added.
    The government has set public sector wage rises at aboout
1.7 per cent this year, with a three per cent ceiling for rises
justified by increased productivity.
    But the head of the socialist CFDT union federation, Edmond
Maire, meeting with Chirac today, renewed union demands already
rejected by the government for indexation clauses to be built
into future pay contracts to safeguard workers against higher
prices.
    Calling the government's policies "unbalanced and unjust," he
also demanded investment incentives to boost employment. He
announced after his meeting that Chirac had told him the
government would spend two billion francs on a series of
measures to boost employment and training
    Andre Bergeron, a widely respected leader of the moderate
Force Ouvriere labour group, put similar demands to Chirac
earlier in the week while the Communist-led CGT, the largest of
France's unions, declared the defence of its members earnings
its top priority.
    But with unemployment nearing 11 per cent last month, and
still rising, government supporters and some economic analysts
said they were confident Chirac could resist union pay demands.
    "Salary indexation was ended by the previous Socialist
government and I dont think this administration is going to
reverse that," commented Michel Develle, economist at
recently-privatised Banque Paribas.
    Damaging transport and electricity strikes over Christmas
and the New Year, partly blamed by the government for higher
inflation, had undermined the unions power and popularity, he
said.
    Develle said Paribas expected inflation to rise even more
than the governments revised forecast, perhaps to 2.6 or 2.7
per cent this year against last years 2.1 per cent.
    "But that would still be an exceptional achievement
considering that for the first time since the Second World War
all french prices have been freed," he commented.
    Finance Ministry officials said that the governments
abolition of price and rent controls last year was responsible
for nearly a quarter of a 0.9 per cent surge in January living
costs.
    But they claimed it was a once-off phenomenon that should
have no knock-on impact on the rest of the year.
    Both Marais and Develle said they agreed with that, so long
as the government kept wages under control.
    Prices could rise 1.5 per cent in the first three months of
1987 and two per cent in the first half year, fractionally more
than forecast this week by the National Statistics Institute,
INSEE,  Marais said. But the second half year should be better,
he added.
    Ironically, one side effect of higher inflation could be to
help the government achieve its aim of cutting the state budget
deficit, several analysts said.
    So long as public sector wages are held down, higher Value
Added Tax receipts resulting from rising prices should offset a
loss in revenues that otherwise would result from slower than
expected growth, they said.

<TITLE>JAPAN CONSUMER PRICES FALL 0.4 PCT IN JANUARY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, Feb 27 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japan's unadjusted consumer price index
(base 1985) fell 0.4 pct to 99.7 in January from the previous
month, the government's Management and Coodination Agency said.
    The fall compares with a decline of 0.2 pct in December.
    The January index compared with a year earlier was down 1.1
pct, the first drop larger than 1.0 pct since it fell 1.3 pct
in September 1958.
    Food costs rose in January from December but prices fell
for clothing, footwear and utilities, causing the overall
decline for the month.
    Housing, medical and educations costs increased in January
compared with a year earlier but the cost of utilities,
gasoline and vegetables fell.
    The unadjusted consumer price index for the Tokyo area
(base 1985) was down 0.1 pct in mid-February from a month
earlier at 100.2, reflecting lower prices for food, clothing
and footwear. Compared with a year earlier, the index was down
0.7 pct due to lower vegetable, fuel oil and utility costs.

<TITLE>JAPAN MARCH BOND COUPON SEEN UNCHANGED AT FIVE PCT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>     TOKYO, Feb 27 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Finance Ministry has proposed
informally to its bond underwriting syndicate that the coupon
on the January 10-year government bond remain unchanged from
February at five pct, underwriting sources said.
    They said the ministry wants a 0.50 yen raise in issue
price from February to 99.50 to yield a record low 5.075 pct.
    The 5.151 pct February bond issue yield was itself a record
low. The proposed issue volume is 475 billion yen against the
600 billion in February.
    The underwriting syndicate is likely to accept the proposed
terms immediately, the sources said.

<TITLE>U.S. LAUNCHES WEATHER SATELLITE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>An unmanned Delta rocket
carrying a 57 mln dlr weather observation satellite blasted off
here today in the first U.S. Space launch of the year.
    The 116-foot rocket lifted off at 1805 local time (2305
GMT) and placed in orbit a 1,850 pound Geostationary
Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) to replace an
identical one that was destroyed last May when a Delta rocket
exploded after liftoff.
    Weather forecasters have had only a single satellite to
cover the entire U.S. Since another GOES failed in orbit in
August 1984.
    "We'll have both our weather eyes open again," said Thomas
Pyke, a spokesman for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration, which owns and operates the satellite.
    The smooth launching came after two delays in as many days.
The first was caused by a fuel leak and the second by powerful
crosswinds.
    The Delta was the first of six rockets scheduled for launch
by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration this year.
The launch marked the third straight success for the space
program which was battered by a series of failures in 1986,
including the loss of the Challenger shuttle.

<TITLE>ITALIAN COALITION MEETS AS GOVERNMENT CRISIS LOOMS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ROME, Feb 27 - </DATELINE><BODY>Leaders of Italy's five coalition parties
have agreed to meet today to try to settle their differences
which are mainly between Prime Minister Bettino Craxi's
Socialist Party and the majority Christian Democrats.
    Sources close to Deputy Prime Minister Arnaldo Forlani said
Craxi told him he would announce his resignation next week,
allowing negotiations on a new government leader.
    The conservative Christian Democrats demanded the meeting
after Craxi said a pact agreed during a government crisis last
August, under which he was to hand over the prime minister's
job next month, was unlikely to be fulfilled.
    Political sources said the Christian Democrats are likely
to leave the coalition, which also includes Republicans, Social
Democrats and Liberals, unless they get the prime minister's
job. They said Craxi's plans to resign show he has decided to
stick to the pact but talks on a leader, a government program
and sharing of ministries will not be easy.
    They said there is dissent among the partners and that
Forlani has been trying to mediate to avoid a crisis. They said
the five are likely to begin talks tomorrow on whether
formation of a new government is feasible or early elections
are inevitable. Elections are not due until 1988.

<TITLE>N.Z. CENTRAL BANK SEES SLOWER MONEY, CREDIT GROWTH</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WELLINGTON, Feb 27 - </DATELINE><BODY>Monetary and credit growth rates in
New Zealand are not expected to continue at current levels
following the Reserve Bank's move to tighten liquidity late
last year, Reserve Bank Governor Spencer Russell said.
    The monetary and credit growth figures for the December
quarter were probably artifically inflated by unusually high
growth in inter-institutional lending activity on the short
term money market, Russell said in a statement.
    The bank moved to tighten liquidity when the initial signs
of the recent expansion became apparent in September and
October last year, Russell said.
    Broadly defined M-3 figures released today showed growth of
17.8 pct in the year ended December compared with 13.1 pct in
the year ended September.
    Annual growth of private sector credit in calendar 1986 was
30.7 pct compared with 16.5 pct in the September year.
    "Available evidence suggests that corporate customers,
including non-bank financial institutions, have been exploiting
differences between interest rates on overdrafts with trading
banks and rates in the call market," Russell said.
